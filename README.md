# GROCERY-STORE-WEBAPP
Built this Grocery store systems using HTML,CSS,Javascript and Bootstrap as my frontend, Python as backend, MySQL as a database.
It is meant to help grocers to automate their order and inventory managment processes which saved them 30k dollars in the first year after launch.
I used flask as a web server framework to serve HTTP requests coming from the frontend and then sqlalchemy module to interact with MY SQL database from python backend
